# Local Medication Reminder System

## Overview

The local medication reminder system has been implemented to replace Firebase-based medication reminders with a fully local solution using Hive and SharedPreferences. This provides better offline functionality and eliminates the "unending today's reminders" issue.

## Key Features

### âœ… Local Storage Only

- All medication reminders are stored locally using Hive
- No Firebase dependency for reminders
- Works completely offline
- Data persists across app restarts

### âœ… Smart Notification System

- Uses flutter_local_notifications for reliable local notifications
- Supports different frequencies: Daily, Once, Every 3 Days
- Automatic notification scheduling based on reminder settings
- Proper notification cancellation when reminders are deleted

### âœ… Intelligent Reminder Logic

- Automatically calculates which medications should be taken today
- Filters out already taken medications from today's view
- Supports marking medications as taken/not taken
- Tracks medication adherence locally

### âœ… Seamless UI Integration

- Dashboard shows only untaken reminders for today
- Swipe-to-complete functionality maintained
- Status indicators (Pending, Overdue, Upcoming)
- Enhanced reminder display with frequency information

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **MedicationReminder Model** (`lib/models/offline/medication_reminder.dart`)

   - Hive-based model with typeId 4
   - Stores all reminder data locally
   - Includes taken dates tracking
   - Smart helper methods for status calculation

2. **LocalMedicationReminderService** (`lib/services/local_medication_reminder_service.dart`)

   - Main service handling all reminder operations
   - Manages Hive database operations
   - Handles notification scheduling/cancellation
   - Provides reminder statistics

3. **Updated Schedule Screen** (`lib/screens/main_screen/patient_screens/schedule_medication_screen.dart`)

   - Uses LocalMedicationReminderService instead of Firestore
   - Simplified save process
   - Local-only notification management

4. **Updated Dashboard** (`lib/screens/main_screen/patient_screens/dashboard_screens.dart/dashboard_screen.dart`)
   - Loads reminders from local storage
   - Filters out taken medications
   - Uses local service for marking as taken

### Database Structure

```dart
@HiveType(typeId: 4)
class MedicationReminder extends HiveObject {
  @HiveField(0) String id;
  @HiveField(1) String uid;
  @HiveField(2) String medicationName;
  @HiveField(3) String dosage;
  @HiveField(4) String administrationType;
  @HiveField(5) String frequency;
  @HiveField(6) int reminderTimeHour;
  @HiveField(7) int reminderTimeMinute;
  @HiveField(8) bool notificationEnabled;
  @HiveField(9) DateTime startDate;
  @HiveField(10) DateTime endDate;
  @HiveField(11) String notes;
  @HiveField(12) bool isActive;
  @HiveField(13) DateTime createdAt;
  @HiveField(14) DateTime updatedAt;
  @HiveField(15) List<String> takenDates; // YYYY-MM-DD format
  @HiveField(16) int notificationId; // For local notifications
}
```

### Notification Management

The system uses flutter_local_notifications with these strategies:

- **Daily**: Single repeating notification
- **Once**: Single one-time notification
- **Every 3 Days**: Multiple scheduled notifications

Each reminder gets a unique notification ID based on the reminder ID hash.

## Benefits Over Firebase Approach

### ðŸ”„ No More Unending Reminders

- Local tracking of taken medications prevents reminders from reappearing
- Clean slate every day based on actual medication schedule

### ðŸ“± Better Offline Support

- Works completely offline
- No network dependency for core functionality
- Immediate response to user actions

### ðŸš€ Improved Performance

- Local database queries are much faster
- No network latency
- Reduced app startup time

### ðŸ”’ Enhanced Privacy

- Medication data stays on device
- No cloud storage of sensitive health information
- User has full control over their data

### ðŸ’¾ Reliable Local Notifications

- flutter_local_notifications is more reliable than Firebase messaging
- Works even when app is closed
- Proper handling of notification permissions

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Medication Reminder

```dart
final service = LocalMedicationReminderService();
await service.initialize();

final reminderId = await service.saveMedicationReminder(
  uid: user.uid,
  medicationName: 'Aspirin',
  dosage: '100mg',
  administrationType: 'Oral',
  frequency: 'Daily',
  reminderTime: TimeOfDay(hour: 9, minute: 0),
  notificationEnabled: true,
  startDate: DateTime.now(),
  endDate: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 30)),
  notes: 'Take with food',
);
```

### Getting Today's Reminders

```dart
final todaysReminders = await service.getTodaysMedicationReminders(user.uid);
// Returns only reminders that should be taken today and haven't been taken yet
```

### Marking Medication as Taken

```dart
await service.markMedicationTaken(reminderId);
// Automatically updates local storage and refreshes UI
```

## Migration Notes

The system is designed to work alongside the existing Firebase infrastructure without conflicts:

1. **Existing Firebase reminders**: Will continue to work but won't create new ones
2. **New reminders**: Are created locally only
3. **Data isolation**: Local and Firebase data don't interfere with each other
4. **Gradual migration**: Users can transition naturally as they create new reminders

## Technical Considerations

### Storage

- Uses Hive box `medication_reminders` for data storage
- Automatic box opening and adapter registration
- Efficient local queries and updates

### Notifications

- Uses unique notification IDs to prevent conflicts
- Proper cleanup when reminders are deleted or modified
- Handles notification permissions gracefully

### Error Handling

- Graceful fallbacks when services fail to initialize
- Comprehensive error logging
- Non-blocking error handling for better user experience

## Future Enhancements

1. **Backup/Restore**: Export/import local reminders
2. **Advanced Scheduling**: Custom repeat patterns
3. **Adherence Reports**: Local medication adherence tracking
4. **Reminder Templates**: Saved medication profiles
5. **Integration**: Sync with health apps (optional)

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests covering:

- âœ… Reminder creation and storage
- âœ… Frequency logic validation
- âœ… Today's reminders calculation
- âœ… Taken medication tracking
- âœ… Statistics generation

## Support

For any issues with the local medication reminder system:

1. Check device notification permissions
2. Verify Hive storage integrity
3. Review notification service initialization
4. Check local reminder service logs

The system is designed to be robust and self-healing, with automatic recovery from most error conditions.
